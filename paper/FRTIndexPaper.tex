%%%%%%%%% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
\noindent \emph{Early working draft. Comments welcome.} \\
For financial supervision to be effective, regulators need have accurate information about financial sector activities. For the public to be able to hold supervisors accountable then need access to the information financial supervisors have about the health of the banking system. In this paper we use Bayesian item response theory techniques to create a global and comparable Financial Regulatory Transparency (FRT) Index. The Index captures high income country's reporting to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund's Global Financial Development data set. 
\end{abstract}

In previous research we have found that even within the relatively homogeneous European Union with supranational authorities tasked with gathering and reporting aggregate financial data from member states there is considerable variation in what is actually reported \cite[see][]{Gandrud2014a}. We currently lack a comparable cross-national way of measuring country's level of financial regulatory transparency. In this paper we use a Bayesian Item Response Theory (IRT) approach

\section{Creating the FRT Index}

We treat financial regulatory transparency as an unobserved latent variable that effectively summarizes countries likelihood of reporting yearly data that is included in the World Bank's Global Financial Development data (GFDD) set first created by \cite{Cihak2012}.\footnote{Access to the most updated version of the data set is available through \url{http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/global-financial-development} Accessed February 2014.}

\subsection{Included indicators}

To measure financial supervisory transparency we first gathered data on whether or not governments reported data on a subset of indicators that are included in the World Bank's Global Financial Development data set. We followed Hollyer et al.`s \citeyearpar{Hollyer2014} criteria for inclusion of variables and countries. First, we only include indicators that are reported by at least one country for each year in the period 1998-2011. This gave us the greatest coverage of indicators that are comparable across countries. Second, we excluded all indicators that were explicitly gathered for only a subset of countries. As such we avoided including data where the primary source was the Bank for International Settlements. Third, we did not include any indicator that was primarily from a non-governmental source. This included both indicators from World Bank Sponsored surveys, such as the Global Financial Inclusion Survey and the Enterprise Survey. It also included data primarily derived from sources such as Swiss Re's Sigma Reports, Standard \& Poor, Bankscope, and Bloomberg. Fourth, we did not include variables that are linear combinations of other variables. Fifth, we did not include variables that were simply references to the same quantity in different units. [CHECK TO SEE IF 4 AND 5 ARE RELEVANT] Sixth, we aim to focus on countries that have relatively highly developed banking systems. As such we include only countries and jurisdictions that the World Bank classifies as 'high income'.\footnote{We include both OECD and non-OECD high income countries.} Countries with levels of income this low likely do not have financial systems sophisticated enough to have the quantities reported in the indicators. 

Using these criteria our model has 60 countries, 21 items, and 12 years (1998-2011). Table~\ref{IndTable} shows the list of indicator items and descriptions.

\end{table}

\subsection{The model}

As in \cite{Hollyer2014} we let $y_{j,c,t} \in \{0,\; 1\}$ indicate a variable that is 1 when a country $c$ reports a GFDD variable $j$ in year$t$. It is 0 otherwise. We then estimate the model:

\[
    \mathrm{Pr}(y_{j,c,t} = 1|transparency_{c,t} = \mathrm{logit}(\delta_{j} + \beta_{j}transparency_{c,t})
\]

The following parameters are estimated in the model:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\delta_{j}$ is the difficulty parameter of item $j$,
    \item $\beta_{j}$ the discrimination parameter for item $j$,
    \item $transparency_{c,t}$ is the estimated propensity of a given country-year $c,t$ to disclose financial regulatory data
\end{itemize}


\section{Description and Validity}


\subsection{The FRT Index}

Figures \ref{FRT_1998}, \ref{FRT_2007}, and \ref{FRT_2011} provide snapshots of the Financial Regulatory Transparency Index in the years 1998 (the Index's first year), 2007, and 2011 (the Index's current end year). Higher scores on the FRT Index indicate higher financial regulatory transparency.

We should first notice that the index passes a face validity test. There is a noticeable cluster of countries with very low FRT scores. These countries include the Bermuda, Cayman Islands, the Isle of Man, and Monaco. All of these jurisdictions are known for their banking secrecy, often as explicit policy decisions to attract capital from those seeking to avoid paying taxes in their home jurisdictions. At the high end of the scale we also see countries that have been known for their transparency. \cite{Gandrud2014a} noted a high level of financial regulatory transparency in the United States' financial regulatory reporting practices relative to practices among many European Union countries. As we would expect from this work, the United States is regularly placed among the countries with the highest FRT score.  

Changes in countries' FRT scores over time also reflect substantively meaningful policy changes. Hungary is a prime example, in 1998 it is estimated to have one of the highest FRT scores. [Mark H. COULD YOU WRITE THIS UP?]

It's important to also note that the FRT Index provides distinct information

\section{Preliminary Associations}

To demonstrate the potential usefulness of the FRT Index we examine a number of associations between the Index and the occurrence and potential occurrence of financial crisis.
