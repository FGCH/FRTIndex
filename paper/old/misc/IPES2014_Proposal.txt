Mark Copelovitch, Christopher Gandrud, and Mark Hallerberg 

Why do countries release data on their financial systems to international organizations such as the IMF and World Bank? What are the consequences of releasing this data for the stability of their financial systems? To answer these questions we use Bayesian Item Response Theory to create a new, global, and comparable Financial Regulatory Transparency (FRT) Index. The Index currently covers the years 1998 through 2011. It includes 60 high income countries that report to the World Bank's Global Financial Development Database. The FRT Index is a distinct indicator of government willingness to gather and make available to international investors minimally credible information about their financial systems. We find that the effect of transparency on banking system stability is contingent on a country's economic institutional quality. Countries with high quality institutions gain more stability with greater transparency. Countries with lower quality institutions that increase transparency to attract international investment conversely have less stable financial institutions. This may be because their regulators are unable to respond adequately to increased capital inflows.
